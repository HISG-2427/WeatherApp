**Weather App**

*Technologies* - HTML, CSS, JavaScript

***Project Description***

*Objective* 
In this project, you will create a web-based weather application that allows users to
enter a location and retrieve the current weather conditions for that location. The app should
display details such as temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the current
weather.

*Skills to Practice*
● HTML for structuring the app.
● CSS for styling and layout.
● JavaScript for fetching weather data and interactivity.
● Integrating with a public weather API.

*Requirements*
Your weather app should include the following features:
- User Input: Provide a text input field where users can enter the name of a city or location
for which they want to check the weather.
- Submit Button: Include a "Submit" button that, when clicked, triggers the weather data
retrieval.
- Display Weather Data: After a user submits a location, display the current weather
conditions for that location. This should include temperature (in Celsius), weather
description (e.g., "Sunny," "Cloudy," "Rainy"), and an icon representing the current weather
condition.
- Styling: Apply CSS to make your weather app visually appealing. Ensure it's responsive
and user-friendly.
- Use of Public Weather API: You are required to use a public weather API to fetch weather
data for the entered location. One popular option is the OpenWeatherMap API
(https://openweathermap.org/), which provides a free tier.
- Error Handling: Implement error handling in case the user enters an invalid location or if
there are issues with the API request. Provide appropriate error messages to the user.

*Project Guidelines*
● Start by creating the HTML structure for your app. Include the necessary input fields and
placeholders for displaying weather data.
● Style your app using CSS to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.
● Use JavaScript to handle user interactions and to fetch weather data from the chosen
weather API. Ensure that the data is displayed clearly and comprehensively to the user.
● Consider responsive design to make your app look good on various screen sizes.
● Test your app thoroughly to ensure it functions correctly. Pay special attention to error
handling and providing informative messages to users.
● You may choose to use asynchronous JavaScript (Promises or async/await) for making API
requests.
● Ensure that you are complying with the terms and conditions of the chosen weather API,
especially if you plan to deploy the app publicly.
